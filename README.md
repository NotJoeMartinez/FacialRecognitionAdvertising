# FacialRecognitionAdvertising
Displays billboard advertisements to users based off attributes detected via facial recognition software. 

## Inspiration
- Digital marketing 
- LED billboards
- Facebook Ads Platform 
## What it does
- Obtains user attributes via web cam and tailors ads to identified demographic 
## How we built it
- The OpenCV python library was used for facial detection 
- Neural net models detect user attributes set by developer 
- Advertisements were then shown based off of the user attributes detected 
## Challenges we ran into
- Integrating the facebook graph API 
- Interfacing python with Node.js 
- Parsing JSON data from python requests module  
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Displaying ads based on user profile/attributes 
## What we learned
- HTTP requests
- Complex API integrations
- Deploying a neural network 
## What's next for FacialRecognitionAdvertising
- Detecting more user attributes 
- Increasing accuracy of attribute classification
- Integrating data with advertising API
